  # POPCORN RENDEZVOUS

#### Created By WAMBUI KARANJA on 03-06-2023



## Description

Popcorn Rendezvous is a a website that allows one to book movies of their choice.Once one had seen the movies on the site,one can select the preferable movie,select the exact seat ,and be able to make payment through a payment form that has been provided.A subscribe form is displayed to allow user to subscribe in order to receive special emails and offers.

Some of the Challenges I faced and will implement them better in the future:
 -Implementing the appearance of the seat container
 
 -Good positioning of the button that displays the amount to be payed
 
 -Having different seat data for each movie with different seats(currently using the same seat data)
 
 -fetching the seat data from the server:The current seatMap is dynamically created.
 
 -creating and adding more modes of payment.
 
 -adding buttons to link to youtube videos for trailers
